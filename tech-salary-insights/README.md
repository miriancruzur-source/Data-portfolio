Technology Salary Insights Project
*End-to-End Data Project using SQL + Tableau (2020–2024)*

This project provides a complete data analytics workflow using SQL and Tableau to analyze global tech salaries between **2020 and 2024**.  
It covers data cleaning, SQL-based exploration, and interactive dashboard development.

The final Tableau dashboard allows users to explore salary trends by job role, experience level, remote work modality, country, and company size.

#Project Overview

This repository showcases a full data project that transforms raw salary data into meaningful insights.  
The dataset includes 10,000 salary records from tech professionals worldwide across a 5-year period.

The project follows this pipeline:

1. **Data Cleaning (SQL)** — standardizing text, fixing labels, removing invalid values.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)** — aggregations, trends, and benchmarks.  
3. **Data Visualization (Tableau)** — building an interactive salary dashboard.

#1. Data Cleaning (SQL)

- Standardized Experience Level (EN → Entry-level, MI → Mid-level, etc.)
- Cleaned Employment Type (FT, PT, Contract, Freelance)
- Categorized Remote Work into On-site / Hybrid / Fully Remote
- Ensured all salaries were positive
- Removed inconsistencies and trimmed whitespace

#2. Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

Key questions explored using SQL:
-Which job roles have the highest salaries?
